Version: 0.2.0
Author: CL Roberts

Description: This package contains utility functions and documentation for a Sitka 
    herring threshold analysis. This analysis is to re-evaluate a management 
    threshold for a herring stock in Sitka Sound, Alaska. The current threshold is 
    set to 16,759 tons, or 25% of the simulated average unfished biomass as 
    established in `Carlile (1998)`. Tools for simulating, plotting, and analyzing 
    average unfished biomass in Sitka herring are given here. However, code and 
    methodology is hopefully general enough to be applied to other stocks.
