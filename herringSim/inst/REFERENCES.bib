    abstract = {The Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) population in Prince William Sound, Alaska crashed in 1993 and has yet to recover, affecting food web dynamics in the Sound and impacting Alaskan communities. To help researchers design and implement the most effective monitoring, management, and recovery programs, a Bayesian assessment of Prince William Sound herring was developed by reformulating the current model used by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. The Bayesian model estimated pre-fishery spawning biomass of herring age-3 and older in 2013 to be a median of 19,410 mt (95% credibility interval 12,150–31,740 mt), with a 54% probability that biomass in 2013 was below the management limit used to regulate fisheries in Prince William Sound. The main advantages of the Bayesian model are that it can more objectively weight different datasets and provide estimates of uncertainty for model parameters and outputs, unlike the weighted sum-of-squares used in the original model. In addition, the revised model could be used to manage herring stocks with a decision rule that considers both stock status and the uncertainty in stock status.},

    abstract = "{Incorporating ecological covariates into fishery stock assessments may improve estimates, but most covariates are estimated with error. Model selection criteria are often used to identify support for covariates, have some limitations and rely on assumptions that are often violated. For a more rigorous evaluation of ecological covariates, we used four popular selection criteria to identify covariates influencing natural mortality or recruitment in a Bayesian stock assessment of Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) in Prince William Sound, Alaska. Within this framework, covariates were incorporated either as fixed effects or as latent variables (i.e. covariates have associated error). We found most support for pink salmon increasing natural mortality, which was selected by three of four criteria. There was ambiguous support for other fixed effects on natural mortality (walleye pollock and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation) and recruitment (hatchery-released juvenile pink salmon and a 1989 regime shift). Generally, similar criteria values among covariates suggest no clear evidence for a consistent effect of any covariate. Models with covariates as latent variables were sensitive to prior specification and may provide potentially very different results. We recommend using multiple criteria and exploring different statistical assumptions about covariates for their use in stock assessment.}",

  abstract = { Integrated analysis models provide a tool to estimate fish abundance, recruitment, and fishing mortality from a wide variety of data. The flexibility of integrated analysis models allows them to be applied over extended time periods spanning historical decades with little information from which to estimate the annual signal of recruitment variability to modern periods in which more information about recruitment variability exists. Across this range of data availability, the estimation process must assure that the estimated log-normally distributed recruitments are mean unbiased to assure mean unbiased biomass estimates. Here we show how the estimation method implemented in the integrated analysis model, Stock Synthesis, achieves this unbiased characteristic in a penalized likelihood approach that is comparable to the results from Markov chain Monte Carlo. The total variability in recruitment is decomposed into variability among annual recruitment estimates based on information in the data and a residual variability. Because data are never perfectly informative, we show that estimated recruitment variability will always be less than the true variability among recruitments and that the method implemented here can be used to iteratively estimate the true variability among recruitments. }
